// https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/

// An image is represented by an m x n integer grid image where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image.

// You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].

// To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with color.

// Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.

// Example 1:

// Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2
// Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
// Explanation: From the center of the image with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1) (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.
// Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected to the starting pixel.
// Example 2:

// Input: image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0
// Output: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
// Explanation: The starting pixel is already colored 0, so no changes are made to the image.

// Constraints:

// m == image.length
// n == image[i].length
// 1 <= m, n <= 50
// 0 <= image[i][j], color < 216
// 0 <= sr < m
// 0 <= sc < n
